# Treeform's & Guzba's hobby

Our hobby is to create Nim libraries that end with y. Here is a list of our libraries and short descriptions on why you should use them:

Most of them only depend on the Nim Standard library or our other libraries.

![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/guzba/zippy)

Zippy is an implementation of DEFLATE, ZLIB and GZIP data compression formats.

Zippy can also open ZIP archives (.zip) and Tarballs (.tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .taz).

The goal of this library is to be a pure Nim implementation that is small, performant and dependency-free.


## [Jsony](https://github.com/treeform/jsony)

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/treeform/jsony)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/treeform/jsony)

A loose, direct to object JSON parser and serializer with hooks.

Real world json is never what you want. It might have extra fields that you don't care about. It might have missing fields requiring default values. It might change or grow new fields at any moment. Json might use camelCase or snake_case. It might use inconsistent naming.

With this library you can use json your way, from the mess you get to the objects you want.

* Parses and serializes JSON very fast.
* newHook, postHook, enumHook, renameHook, parseHook, dumpHook, skipHook
* Support for JSON-in-JSON and raw JSON.



## [Mummy](https://github.com/guzba/mummy)

![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/guzba/mummy)

Mummy is a multi-threaded HTTP 1.1 and WebSocket server written entirely in Nim.
Mummy has been written specifically to maximize the performance of your server hardware without compromising on programmer happiness.

* Supports HTTP keep-alive and gzip response compression automatically.
* Built-in first-class WebSocket support.
* Multiplexed socket IO without the {.async.} price.



## [Genny](https://github.com/treeform/genny)

![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/treeform/genny)

Generate Nim library bindings for many languages

So you made a cool Nim library but you want it to be available to other languages as well. With `genny` you can generate a dynamically linked library with a simple C API and generated bindings for many languages. In some ways its similar to [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) project for C or [djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni) for C++.



## [Puppy](https://github.com/treeform/puppy)

![Github Actions](https://github.com/treeform/puppy/workflows/Github%20Actions/badge.svg)
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/treeform/puppy)

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/treeform/puppy)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/treeform/puppy)

Fetch resources via HTTP and HTTPS.

Puppy does not use Nim's HTTP stack, instead it uses `WinHttp` API on Windows , `AppKit` on macOS, and `libcurl` on Linux. Because Puppy uses system APIs, there is no need to ship extra `*.dll`s, `cacert.pem`, or forget to pass the `-d:ssl` flag. This also has the effect of producing slightly smaller binaires.



## [Netty](https://github.com/treeform/netty)

![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/treeform/netty)

Reliable UDP connection for Nim.

Netty is a reliable connection over UDP aimed at games. Normally UDP packets can get duplicated, dropped, or come out of order. Netty makes sure packets are not duplicated, re-sends them if they get dropped, and all packets come in order. UDP packets might also get split if they are above 512 bytes and also can fail to be sent if they are bigger than 1-2k. Netty breaks up big packets and sends them in pieces making sure each piece comes reliably in order. Finally sometimes it's impossible for two clients to communicate direclty with TCP because of NATs, but Netty provides hole punching which allows them to connect.


## [Shady](https://github.com/treeform/shady)

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/treeform/shady)
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/treeform/shady)

Nim to GPU shader language compiler and supporting utilities.

Shady can compile a subset of Nim into `OpenGL Shader Language` used by the GPU. This allows you to test your shader code with `echo` statements on the CPU and then run the exact same code on the GPU.

* Write vertex and fragment/pixel shaders for games and 3d applications.
* Write compute shaders for offline processing and number crunching.


## [Chroma](https://github.com/treeform/chroma)

Boxy is an easy to use 2D GPU rendering API built on top of Pixie.

The basic model for using Boxy goes something like this:

* Open a window and prepare an OpenGL context.
* Load image files like .png using Pixie.
* Render any dynamic assets (such as text) into images once using Pixie.
* Add these images to Boxy, where they are put into a tiling atlas texture.
* Draw these images to screen each frame.

Spatial data structures for Nim.

Spatial algorithms are used to find the "closest" things faster than simple brute force iteration would. They make your code run faster using smarter data structures. This library has different "Spaces" that you can use to speed up games and graphical applications.

* BruteSpace (for loop)
* SortSpace (quick sort)
* HashSpace (2d hash table)
* QuadSpace (Quad-tree)

Orbits are beautiful, with their gentle curves and sweeping arcs. They have captivated astronomers for thousands of years and have made mathematics and physics to what they are today. There is so much to the orbits if you dig dipper. Where do you get most accurate data? How do you compute transfer windows? Can you plot trajectories of spacecraft? This is what this library is about. An exploration of deep beyond with Nim at your side.

* Simple Elliptical Orbits
* Kernel Files Orbits (NASA's .bsp SPICE SP-kernels)

Fast CSV parser with hooks.

This library parses `.csv` or `.tsv` files directly into Nim objects. This is different from how Nim's standard library [parsecsv](https://nim-lang.org/docs/parsecsv.html) works which first parses them into an intermediate representation. This makes `tabby` generate fewer memory allocations.

Curly makes pooling and reusing `libcurl` handles easy.

Why pool and reuse `libcurl` handles? Doing so enables reusing Keep-Alive connections. This is especially beneficial for servers frequently making requests to HTTPS endpoints by skipping the need to open a new connection and do a TLS handshake for every request.

JWTea enables the creation of JSON Web Tokens in pure Nim, without any dependency on OpenSSL or other external libraries. OpenSSL is one of the truly legendary sources of programmer pain so this repo was motivated by refusing that dependency.
